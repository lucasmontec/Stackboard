# Stackboard
A simple JAVA clipboard helper that lets you stack text (currently only text).

##How to use
When active you can use the clipboard normally.
To stack text instead of just copying it, you press Ctrl+WindowsKey+C. This will
stack the current content of the clipboard.
To paste the top of the stack and pop it (replacing the content of the clipboard with the next element)
just press Ctrl+WindowsKey+V.

##TL;DR
Use Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V normally.
To use the stack, Ctrl+WindowsKey+C and Ctrl+WindowsKey+V
